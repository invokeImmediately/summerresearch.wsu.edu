<p><a href="/research-opportunities/#bioplastics" target="_blank"><strong>Center for Bioplastics and Biocomposites (CB2).</strong></a> Industry-directed projects will offer hands-on experience with synthesis, processing and characterization of biobased plastics and composite materials. The program is led by Michael Kessler, co-director of the CB2 and the Berry Family director and professor of the School for Mechanical and Materials Engineering.</p>
<p><a href="/research-opportunities/#disease-diagnostics" target="_blank"><strong>Engineering Tools for Disease Diagnostics and Treatment.</strong></a> Nine students per year will explore the interface of health science and engineering to design better tools for predicting and treating global challenges such as infections, cardiac diseases, osteoarthritis, diabetes, ergonomic problems and cancers. The program is led by Nehal Abu-Lail, the Linda Voiland professor in the School of Chemical Engineering and Bioengineering.</p>
<p><a href="/research-opportunities/#nara-sure" target="_blank"><strong>Northwest Advanced Renewables Alliance (NARA) Summer Undergraduate Research Experience (SURE).</strong></a> Developed from a larger aviation biofuels project that WSU led for five years, NARA SURE will host eight undergraduates per year for biofuels and bioproducts research along with bioenergy literacy education. Led by Shelley Pressley, associate research professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and director of the WSU Office of Undergraduate Education, the program will have two sites: WSU Pullman and the McCall Outdoor Science School in McCall, Idaho.</p>
