What’s the impact on rivers and aquatic creatures when biojet fuel is produced from wood products? What are the nutrient needs of microorganisms whose job is to keep farm soil stable?
<p class="nrml">These and about 70 more intriguing questions will be answered in person at the Tuesday, Aug. 2 Summer Undergraduate Research Symposium from10 a.m. to 1 p.m. in Smith CUE Atrium at Washington State University.</p>
<p class="nrml">Dozens of undergraduates from universities across the nation will present posters at the annual event, showing results from their summer work with mentoring WSU research professors. The poster session is free and open to the public.</p><!--more-->
<p class="nrml">The showcase is hosted by the Office of Undergraduate Research, part of WSU Undergraduate Education. The office coordinates student services across 12 research projects led by WSU faculty in Pullman, Vancouver, and Spokane.</p>
<p class="nrml">“Washington State has welcomed undergraduate researchers from top U.S. universities for summer programs for several years, and the group here this summer is one of the best,” said Shelley Pressley, director of the office.</p>
